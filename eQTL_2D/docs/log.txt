Available data:

500k SNPs on 900 related individuals
18000 traits, of which 7000 have values for all individuals

4 million imputed SNPs
300 unrelateds

1700 individuals with other phenotypes


500k on 900 individuals will take ~4 hours on C2075

run analysis in v1 directory

data management

currently all genotype data is separated by chromosomes in merlin format
/hpscratch/wrayvisscher/GWAS/GWAS/GeneralRelease/Release6/linkage/GWAS_Adolescent_chr*.ped.gz

filtered snp list is:
/hpscratch/wrayvisscher/GWAS/GWAS/GeneralRelease/Release6/info/GWAS.SNPlist


this needs to be converted into single binary plink file format.


in the phenotype data there are 2 extra individuals - rows 829 and 860. they need to be removed

first run makemapfiles.R:
$ R --no-save < makemapfiles.R

then run paste_genome2.sh:

$ qsub submit.sh

this is a 22 task job array

then run 

$ qsub submit2.sh

this runs plink and pastes the analyses together using the merge file merge.txt

problem with individuals.

probe_signal_N10.csv has 862 individuals (rows 829 and 860 are extra)
ILMN_1720083.ped     has 860 individuals
GWAS data            has ~6000 individuals - but missing 2 individuals present in ILMN_1720083.ped
