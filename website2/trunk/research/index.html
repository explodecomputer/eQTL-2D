					<p>Peter Visscher is a Senior Principal Research Fellow (SPRF) at QIMR, and holds an honorary professorship with the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at UQ. He was born in Holland from Dutch and English parents. His children are first backcrosses. After obtaining a BSc in Animal Science he worked for a couple of years in the Department of Agriculture in Holland before moving to Edinburgh for a Masters and PhD in animal breeding and genetics (supervised by Bill Hill FRS and Robin Thompson FRSE), working on the estimation of genetic parameters in large dairy cattle pedigrees.</p>
					
					<p>A productive postdoc with Mike Goddard (Melbourne) was followed by a return to Edinburgh, where he worked with Chris Haley (Roslin Institute) on marker-assisted-selection and QTL mapping methodology. In 1995 he moved to a faculty position at the University of Edinburgh, working on QTL mapping methods, software tools and practical applications. Since ~1998 his main interest and research focus has been in genetic epidemiology, statistical genetics and human quantitative & population genetics. He joined the Queensland Institute of Medical Research in January 2005.</p>

						<h2>Whole genome methods</h2>
						<p>Quantitative genetics theory has a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics and is well established following the ground breaking work by Fisher and Wright nearly a century ago. Estimation of genetic parameters, such as heritability and genetic correlation coefficients, and applications in human genetics, evolutionary biology and plant and animal breeding programmes, are based upon the specific theory of the resemblance between relatives due to genetic factors. The resemblance between relatives depends on the number of alleles that they share identicalby-descent (IBD) at loci inﬂuencing the trait of interest.</p>
						<P>Due to segregation and linkage, the actual number of alleles shared IBD is the outcome of a stochastic process. Until quite recently, IBD sharing between relatives could not be observed, and the theoretical expected value, based upon probabilities, is typically used in applications. If there are many (strictly infinite) independent loci inﬂuencing a phenotype, then there is no difference between the expected and actual proportion of alleles shared IBD between relatives. The infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics leads to appealing theoretical consequences (e.g., multivariate normality of additive genetic values) and its application has been highly successful, particularly in animal breeding selection programmes.</p>
						<P>Nevertheless, genes reside on a finite, relatively small number of chromosomes, and recombination events during meiosis are relatively infrequent, typically 1-3 per 100 cM. This implies that large segments of chromosomes segregate from parents to progeny, which creates variation in the proportion of the genome shared between pairs of relatives around the expected value.</p>

						<h2>Transcriptomics</h2>
							<p>Psychiatric genetics, a subfield of behavioral neurogenetics, studies the role of genetics in psychological conditions such as alcoholism,schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. The basic principle behind psychiatric genetics is that genetic polymorphisms, as indicated by linkage to e.g. a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), are part of the etiology of psychiatric disorders.</p>
							<p>The goal of psychiatric genetics is to better understand the etiology of psychiatric disorders, to use that knowledge to improve treatment methods, and possibly also to develop personalized treatments based on genetic profiles (see pharmacogenomics). In other words, the goal is to transform parts of psychiatry into a neuroscience-based discipline.</p>
							<p>Linkage, association, and microarray studies generate raw material for findings in psychiatric genetics.[3] Copy number variants have also been associated with psychiatric conditions.</p>
							<p>Most psychiatric disorders are highly heritable; the estimated heritability for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism (80% or higher) is much higher than that of diseases like breast cancer and Parkinson disease. However, linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies have found few reproducible risk factors.</p>
							<p>Several genetic risk factors have been found with the endophenotypes of psychiatric disorders, rather than with the diagnoses themselves. That is, the risk factors are associated with particular symptoms, not with the overall diagnosis.</p>

						<h2>Psychiatric genetics</h2>
						<p>The human genome contains the complete set of genes required to build a functional human being. However, the genome is only a source of information. In order to function, it must be expressed. The transcription of genes to produce RNA is the first stage of gene expression . The transcriptome is the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by the genome at any one time. Unlike the genome, the transcriptome is extremely dynamic. Most of our cells contain the same genome regardless of the type of cell, stage of development or environmental conditions. Conversely, the transcriptome varies considerably in these differing circumstances due to different patterns of gene expression.</p>
						<p>Transcriptomics, the study of the transcriptome, is therefore a global way of looking at gene expression patterns. Why is transcriptomics of interest? There are many different ways in which the large-scale analysis of gene expression patterns can be useful. These include: To answer specific questions about gene expression. For example, which genes are activated by a particular transcription factor? This sort of question can be addressed by comparing gene expression patterns in tissues in which the particular transcription factor is either active or inactive. General discovery experiments. These have no particular hypothesis but can be used to identify interesting genes. For example, which genes are highly expressed in brain tumours but not in healthy brain tissue? Can these be used as drug targets or diagnostic markers?</p>
						<p>Sometimes single markers are not sufficient to distinguish two similar diseases, as is often the case in cancer. Testing the expression profiles of a larger number of genes can provide accurate diagnoses. Functional annotation. Many DNA sequences that have been isolated have no known function. However, if they show similar expression patterns to a characterised gene, it is likely their functions are similar. It is sometimes possible to identify conserved regulatory elements in such genes. To identify drug targets. If the gene expression profile caused by a mutation is similar to that caused by a drug, it is likely the drug interacts with and inactivates the protein affected by the mutation. How is transcriptomics studied? There are a number of different methods but currently the most popular is the use of DNA microarrays.</p>
